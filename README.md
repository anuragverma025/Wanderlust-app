## 📖 About the Project

**Wanderlust** is a feature-rich web application inspired by Airbnb, designed to connect travelers with unique accommodation options. Built using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, it offers a seamless experience for users to browse listings, view locations on interactive maps, and manage bookings.

The platform distinguishes between **Host** and **Guest** roles, allowing users to monetize their properties while offering travelers a secure way to discover and book stays. It features server-side validation, secure authentication, and cloud-based image storage.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏨 Core Listing Management
* **CRUD Operations:** Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete property listings.
* **Image Uploads:** Integrated with **Cloudinary** and **Multer** for seamless cloud storage of listing photos.
* **Geocoding & Maps:** Powered by **Mapbox API**. When a user creates a listing, the location is automatically converted to coordinates (Geocoding) and displayed on an interactive map.

### 🔍 Search & Discovery
* **Advanced Search:** Users can search destinations by city, country, or keywords.
* **Category Filters:** Dynamic filtering for categories like "Trending," "Castles," "Arctic," and "Amazing Pools."

### 📅 Booking System (Host & Guest Workflows)
* **Booking Requests:** Guests can select check-in/check-out dates and send booking requests.
* **"My Trips" Dashboard:** Guests can track the status of their upcoming trips (Pending/Confirmed).
* **Host Dashboard:** Property owners receive real-time requests and can **Accept** or **Reject** bookings directly from their management panel.

### 💬 Review & Rating System
* **Interactive Reviews:** Users can leave star ratings and written reviews for listings.
* **Starability:** Visual star rating interface for better UX.
* **Authorization:** Users can only delete reviews they have authored.

### 🛡️ Security & Architecture
* **MVC Pattern:** Clean separation of concerns (Models, Views, Controllers) for maintainable code.
* **Authentication:** Secure login and signup using **Passport.js** (PBKDF2 hashing).
* **Authorization Middleware:** Protects sensitive routes (e.g., only the listing owner can edit their listing).
* **Data Validation:** Robust server-side validation using **Joi** schema validation to prevent bad data entry.
* **Flash Messages:** Instant feedback for success/error actions.
